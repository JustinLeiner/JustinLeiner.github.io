			<h3><a href="https://19tones.com/"> 19tones </a></h3>
			<p>
				Simple Description: This is the website of a photograpgher known as 19tones. This website acts as a store front, portfolio, and place of contact for 19tones.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Contrast -  Makes good use of contrast by utilizing black and white as the main color choices for his website. He does have a scrolling background that is orange and blue, but he has dimmed it so it still falls in line with the tones he is already presenting.</li>
				<li>Repitition - He uses a primary color palette of black and white. His secondary color palette consists of tones that blend nicely with the rest of the website. He uses allcaps and underline to clearly define sections. This use of repition gives his work a unfiied look.</li>
				<li>Alignment - His website seems to possess no alignment at first glance. However, as you continue to look throughout his webiste, he uses a pattern style when arranging his content that gives it alignment.</li>
				<li>Proximity - He has clearly defined sections that breakdown and organize his content into their respective categories. His pattern use makes it obvious how sections of his webiste are related. </li>
			</ul>

		<section>
			<h3><a href="https://www.arngren.net/"> Arngren </a></h3>
			<p>
				Simple Description: This is the website where uses can list items they want to sell. It is very similar to craiglist, except it is exclsuively designed for Norwegians. 
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Contrast -  Website is a mixed bag, overall failing to provide good contrast becasue it is flooded with diffent colored imgages and text</li>
				<li>Repitition - The website does make use of repetition .Each image is bordered in black and colorful text is used to highlight the price tag, however becuase there is an abundance of reptition, it becomes hard to follow. It makes everything on the page blend together since its not very distinct.  </li>
				<li>Alignment - The webpage has no alignment. Everything is thrown together in a way where it looks like it is scrunched and barely fits.</li>
				<li>Proximity - The webpage has decent proximity as most listings and its associatve information are wrapped in black containers to help distinguish which information belongs to which lsiting.</li>
			</ul>
